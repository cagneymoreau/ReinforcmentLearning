#ReinforcementLearning

DL4J comes with RL4J. But  the code is very dense java-esq production code that is hard for beginners to examine.
On top of that, python and tensorflow have been a moving target both migrating to 3.* and 2.* respectively since RL4J release

So I made a gym server fork and this repo to try some RL myself.

I found out that there is a gym for py3.* but check out my gym fork if you want to use this ilbrary and are sturggling with the
other gym_http_api
